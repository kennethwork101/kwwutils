Summary for Australia:

- Australia's coal and gas exports may reduce by half within the next five years due to the passing of its peak and the efforts of Asian countries to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The earnings of minerals and energy exports are predicted to reach $464bn in 2022-23 from $128bn in thermal coal exports and $91bn in liquidified natural gas (LNG) exports. These figures have resulted from the global energy crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to high fossil fuel prices, causing the replacement of Russian gas with alternative supplies in northern hemisphere nations. 

Summary for Indonesia

- Indonesia plans to produce a record 695 million tonnes of coal in 2023 and export 518 million tonnes, according to Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Arifin Tasrif. The country's coal-fired energy supply makes up more than half of its total, though the government aims for a net-zero emissions goal by 2060. Domestic coal consumption in Indonesia is projected at 177 million tonnes this year, down from 193 million tonnes in 2022. 


Summary for China:

- China's coal industry is expected to see stronger trade as the country ramps up energy supplies and stabilizes prices, with coal accounting for 56% of the country's total primary energy consumption. In July 2022, China's coal and lignite exports rose by 171.6% YoY to 230,000 tons. Indonesia is the largest exporter of coal to China, accounting for 58.3% of total imports, followed by Russia at 23.3% and Mongolia at 10%. Australian coal miners are expected to see a pick up in exports to China, while technology and investment from China is set to play a vital role in Indonesian coal deep-processing.
