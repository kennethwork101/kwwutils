- Summary: Pressure is mounting on the Australian government to end public funding for international fossil fuel projects. Australia's major allies, including the US, the UK, Germany, France, and New Zealand, signed the Glasgow Statement last year, committing to ending public support for such projects. However, Australia has refused to commit to this so far. The country's financial support for fossil fuels abroad hasn't changed since May 2022, and the government continues to use taxpayer money to underwrite oil, gas, and coal projects. The Export Finance Australia (EFA), a public financial institution, provides low-interest loans and insurance coverage using government funds to Australian firms looking to offer goods and services overseas.

- Summary: Australia’s Minister for Trade and Tourism Don Farrell emphasized the importance of diversifying their lithium exports and expanding to India rather than letting everything go to the United States due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022. The IRA grants major subsidies to US electric vehicles, which the European Union and South Korea criticized. Australia benefits from the IRA, as it is one of the few countries with a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US and the largest reserves of critical minerals, including lithium. However, the clause that at least 40% of critical minerals for electric batteries must come from countries with an FTA with the US could monopolize Australia’s lithium exports. As the world’s biggest exporter of lithium, Australia looks to boost electric vehicle industries by diversifying its markets to countries like India.
